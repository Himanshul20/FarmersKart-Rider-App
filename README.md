# FarmersKart Rider App Project

A FarmersKart Rider App Project created in flutter using Firebase and Provider. 

## Getting Started

The FarmersKart Rider contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using Custom Widget Design code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.
